<p>
  Welcome to the Zackory Lab in <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu">The Robotics Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>!
  Our research aims at developing intelligent robotic caregivers that enable older adults and people with disabilities to live more independently and maintain a higher quality of life.
  We bring together researchers that explore the intersection of physically assistive robotics, machine learning, physics simulation, perception, and human-robot interaction.
  We focus on new computational and sensing methods for physical human-robot interaction -- methods that allow robots to efficiently and safely assist people with physical impairments to perform activities of daily living.

  We are actively recruiting PhD and Masterâ€™s students to join us in Fall 2021.
  If you are a current or admitted student at CMU and interested in joining our group, please email: <a href="mailto:zackory@cmu.edu">zackory@cmu.edu</a>
